Project Overview: Emotional Awareness Chatbot

The goal of this project is to develop an emotion-aware chatbot that recognizes users' emotions and provides appropriate conversations based on them. 
The emotion-aware chatbot aims to enhance the user experience by understanding 
the emotional signals in the user's interactions and enabling more humane conversations through the appropriate responses.

1. Background
Chatbots are used in many online services in modern times, and they play an important role in customer support, 
information provision, and user interaction. In particular, chatbots with emotion recognition capabilities can provide more personalized services 
by identifying customers' moods and conditions. For example, sending an appropriate consolation message
when a customer expresses a complaint can greatly improve customer satisfaction.

2. Key Features
Emotion Analysis: Inferring emotions from text entered by users. 
For this, we utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to understand the meaning of sentences and classify emotional states
(e.g., happiness, sadness, and anxiety).
Manage Conversations: Adjust the chatbot's conversations according to its emotional state.
For example, if a user expresses his or her feelings of sadness, the chatbot can send words of consolation.
Learning and Adaptation: Chatbots improve more and more with user feedback, 
and can evolve into more natural and personalized conversations away from traditional response patterns.

3. Tech Stack
Python: used to develop chatbots and emotion recognition logic.
Huggingface Transformers: It utilizes natural language processing models to perform emotion recognition.
Pre-trained models such as BERT or RoBERTa can be used to analyze emotions with high accuracy.
Flask: Used to develop web-based user interfaces and APIs. Allows users to enter messages and check the chatbot's response in real time.

4. an expected effect
Improved user experience: Emotional recognition technology allows users to experience more personalized services and conversations.
This leads to better communication by taking into account the emotional factors that arise from interacting with chatbots.
Business Effect: Companies can increase brand loyalty and improve customer satisfaction by understanding and responding appropriately to customers' feelings.

5. Project Action Plan
Step 1: Planning: Define the overall requirements of the project and select libraries and datasets to use.
Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect data suitable for emotion recognition, and preprocess data to fit the model.
Step 3: Model training: Implement and train emotion recognition capabilities with selected models to increase accuracy.
Step 4: Build a Sample Chatbot: Use Flask to develop a user interface and integrate it with the emotion recognition module.
Step 5: Test and Deployment: Test the functionality of the chatbot, improve based on feedback, and finally deploy.
